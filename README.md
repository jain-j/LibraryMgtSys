# LibraryMgtSys
  A small scale library management system which stores data in sqlite db. a best fit as miniproject.

  Just perform following steps....
    1.download and unzip sqlite3 from https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
    2.download and install python (version greater than 3.8)
    3.add LMS.db file in sqlite.
    4.run the LMS.py in with python.
  
  Some important tips:
    1. insert book and author info before insert book record.
    2. enter the db column when "attribute to update" is asked as per your choice.
    3. Never run "LMS.py" twice concurently, because it is sqlite and it does not support multiple connections to db.

Hope you got it and execute successfully.
